# Images

This folder contains images and icons for the WinDev Helper extension.

## Required Files

Before publishing the extension, add the following files:

### icon.png

The extension icon displayed in the VS Code Marketplace.

- **Size:** 128x128 pixels (or 256x256 for high-DPI)
- **Format:** PNG with transparency
- **Guidelines:** Should represent WinUI/Windows development

### hero.png (Optional)

A hero image for the README.

- **Size:** 1280x640 pixels (or similar 2:1 ratio)
- **Format:** PNG or JPEG
- **Content:** Screenshot or promotional image showing the extension in action

## Placeholder

Until actual images are created, the extension will not display an icon in the Marketplace.

To create placeholder images:

1. Use a design tool (Figma, Adobe XD, etc.)
2. Include Windows or WinUI visual elements
3. Export in the required formats

## Guidelines

- Use colors that match the Windows/WinUI brand
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast for visibility
